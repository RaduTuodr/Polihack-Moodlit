This project was developed in collaboration with 3 colleagues from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca during the 48h hackathon Polihack. The project won the originality prize.

The project consists of a smart bed represented by the a frame that has 2 weight sensors under it in order to detect if the child goes to bed. Whenever a sudden spike in the data read from the sensors is detected, it means that the child went to bed, so the Python script starts.
The child is asked random questions generated by ChatGpt in order to find out his mood and generate a tailored story for him. We receive the story in .txt format and transform it to audio using microsoft azure text to speech software. When the child goes asleep(the data read from the sensor doesn`t change for a sequence of several readings) the story stops.

When morning comes, an alarm starts gradually, singing a random child song downloaded from youtube.
The hour of the alarm and the language of the application can be selected from the frontend.

The communication between the sensors and the laptop is realized via Arduino Uno.
